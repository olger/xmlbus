TODO:

CLIENT SUPPORT

Create a command line client that can (a-sync) call xmlbus services, use the transport plugins to support. 
Add mapping of endpoint URIs based on registry resolve functions. 

HTTP TRANSPORT

Currently basic TCP is used for transport, to be more based on currently used standards, implement an embedded webserver for outbound and a http client for inbound transport.

ASYNC SERVICES UPDATE

In order to support ASYNC in the right way, the incoming (request) soapmessage connection should be closed before the service execution function will be triggered. (only if async is indicated (replyto != NULL) (the address information can be part of the  soapMessage, a pipeline implementation can be used to set these (replyto, faultto), ws-addressing can be supported this way
NOTE: Async update will include WS-Addressing for the adressing of endpoints. 
NOTE: Async will be supported after finalization of the client.

MEMORY LEAKS CHECKING
Found using the XCode MallocDebug tool:
- it seems that error string creation and clean is not managed properly. (send a message to the testservice asking for a action that does not exist: you will get a soapfault. Memory is leaked around xmlErrorGetString
